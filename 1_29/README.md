# Welcome

Welcome to our first session. Today you are going to learn more about Git and GitHub.

Let's follow along:
- create your email
- sign up for GitHub
- download Git
- go through Git tutorial

## Step 1: Create your email

If you have your email already, please skip to step 2.

If you don't, let's create an email!

The easiest and quickest email that you can set up is Gmail (in my opinion. Feel free to use anything else if you wish).
Go to the page [!http://gmail.com/](http://gmail.com/) where you will click on `Create Account`:
- it will redirect you to the page that asks for your First Name, Last Name, Username, and password. Make sure that you remember your password;
- once you are done and have your email, Congratulations, you just completed Step 1, move to Step 2 :)

## Step 2: Sign up for GitHub

If you already have GitHub set up, please skip to step 3.

If you don't, let's sign up for GitHub!

You would want to visit [!https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and  click on `Sign Up ` button on top right corner.
- it will redirect you to the page which will ask for your username, email address (make sure to use the one that you often check or a newly created one!);
- create a password that you will remember, maybe even write it somewhere, but do not share it with anyone (unless that someone is your parent of course :));
- Click on the button `Create an Account`;
- You will be redirected to `Choose Your plan`, choose a `Free` option;
- `Step 3 - Tailor your experience` is optional, you don't have to do it;

Once you have your GitHub account ready, make sure to remember your username!
Congratulations, you now have a GitHub account! Let's go to Step 3!


## Step 3: Download Git

As far as the meeting went, most of us have Mac and few have Windows. Just go to [!https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
and choose your operating system. That should be all pretty easy at this point, but if you experience any problems, please refer to this articles:

- [!Installation Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [!Installation Git for MacOs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x)

If you experience any problems at this point, try to solve it on your own. If you can't, you can refer to [!this](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) article.

Once you are done with this (or even if you are stuck), let's still move to Step 4

## Step 4: Go through Git tutorial

In the past, I used to write various tutorials on Git and how to use it. However, within a time, I figured that the best way to learn git is to actually play with it, get your hands dirty, and practice! So I suggest going through the following:

- [!CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) - is by far the best and well-written course on Git;
- [!GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) - is more complex but more extensive tutorial;
- [!Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - one of the most extensive and yet challenging tutorials;
- [!YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4) - a very extensive, almost 2 hours long video. Very well explained, but it's super long;

## THE FINAL STEP

Once you are done with all of those steps, I would like you to fork the [!repo](https://github.com/alekkras/gdg). In order to do this, you will find a button `Fork` on top right corner.
It will copy the repo to your account. Then you would want to `git clone` your repo, open up the folder `1_29` and create a document with your name `yourname.txt`. Inside that document you write:

```
My name is:
My email is:
My GitHub username is:
```

Once you are done with this, you will submit it to your account (HINT: use commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`). Then, you will go to [!my repo](https://github.com/alekkras/gdg), click on the `Pull requests` on top, click on `New pull request` and create it.

P.S. if you experience any problems with that, try to find answers online. If you can't, we will spend some time during the meeting working on that assignment.

YOU GOT THIS :)
