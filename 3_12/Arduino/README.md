# Arduino

In case you want to learn Arduino, that is great and ... not so much!
In order to learn Arduino, you will need to buy a lot of expensive things
but there are plenty of resources to learn that. For the course you will need:

One of the best courses in Arduino that I know for beginners is [this](https://www.instructables.com/lesson/Tools-and-Materials-for-Arduino/)
one. Please look carefully if you are able to purchase all of those materials and follow those lessons.

The whole curriculum will take only 4 lessons but will give a significant boost for your career. However, if you think that it's too expensive,
that's fine (in fact, I think it's pretty pricey myself). You might find [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/popular/arduino-starter-kit.html) shop to be inexpensive.

In that case, we can look at alternatives on building hardware which I can assist more. Few of projects which I can help are:
- Creating your own server;
- Creating your own VPN;
- Creating a Raspberry Pi robot

## Homework

Make a pull request of things you are interested in and also let us know how much money you are willing to spend.
*You will be spending money on buying those resources by yourself*
