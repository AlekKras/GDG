# Welcome to the Midterm / Spring Break

Well, you have gone this far and I acknowledge your motivation to study Computer Science.
For this day, we will just go around the room and I will help individually one-on-one per each
of your problems.

As a homework, I want you to go beyond the regular meeting and be adventurous.

## Homework

When we studies `HTML` you learned how to create a web page.
Last time you added style to it by using `CSS`.
As for now, try to add `JavaScript` code there to have some sort of interaction. Come up with the topic
you are passionate about and make a full web page of it with styles, effects, and everything that
you want to put there. That's it!

We will **not** meet next week because I want to give you some time to work on this. This will be your
midterm project and will be evaluated. Do not stress about it but do a thorough and diligent work.

We **will** meet on **03/12**.
