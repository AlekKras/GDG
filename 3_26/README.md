# IWD

Welcome to one of few classes that are left for this academic year.

I have been thinking about what to teach today and decided  that the best way would be
to provide an opportunity for you to build your own Google Assistant if you are interested
and provide an email support if you face any problems. However, based on your feeback
a lot of people struggle with the material right now and today I will try to explain you in
details the material that you are struggling with.

## Before we start (LINK TO IWD)

Before we start, here is a [link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-1/#0)
to the tutorial on how to build a Google Assistant.

If you experience any problems, please do not hesitate to ask me.

## Let's start

At this point, we have the following:

- We know what `HTML` is, how to add design via `CSS`, and how to add some basic functionality via `JavaScript`;
- We have some understanding on how to build a simple website using a framework called `Bootstrap`;

Now, what is stopping us from starting creating websites and web pages? Nothing really!

If you feel rusty or uncomfortable creating web pages, it is okay! With practice you will gain comfort!

For the rest of the class I would like to cover two things:
- answer any questions regarding `Bootstrap` you might have;
- introduce another framework called `Bulma` and some few minor frameworks that make your job easier;

## Heads-up

We have come quite a long way from the start! And we don't have much left for this academic year. Here are some
important dates!

**IMPORTANT**:
- April 2nd - we start working on the final project, I provide various tools meanwhile so you get more proficient;
- April 9th - we keep working on the final project, I am covering the rest of frameworks that I believe could
help you a lot!, I will also be providing assistance and any help needed;
- April 16th - we don't have class, take that time to complete your final project;
- April 23rd - we have a presentation and the final graduation;
*Note: if you are considering doing an internship or want to try to start working, we can assist you with
finding an internship and/or finding a local business that might be interested in!*

## Homework

It's time for the explanation of the final project!

Remember your mid-term project? Well, now it's time to make it completely perfect! For your final project you will
need to create your own portfolio!
There make sure to say **all** of the following:
- Your name
- Link to your `GitHub`
- Your email
Information that you should **NOT** include:
- Your personal Information;

I provide you with a list of comprehensive and clean portfolios. Get inspired and motivated!
